\usage{
configuration(d, segment = c("Act", "Scene"), mode = c("Active",
  "Passive"), onlyPresence = FALSE)

\method{as.matrix}{QDConfiguration}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{Character vector, should be either "Active" or "Passive".
Passive configurations express when characters are mentioned, active
ones when they speak themselves.}

\item{onlyPresence}{If TRUE, the resulting matrix only contains 
logical values for stage presence}

\item{mtext}{The text including Act and Scene markings}

\item{by}{A string, either "Act" or "Scene". Partial matching allowed.}
}
\description{
Creates classic drama configuration matrix. Returns either a list with 
the three components matrix, drama, and figure, or a data.frame containing everything.
}
\section{Active and Passive Configurations}{

By default, we generate active matrices that are based on 
the character speech. A character is present in a scene or 
act, if they make an utterance. 
Using the argument \code{mode}, we can also create passive
configuration matrices. They look very similar, but are based
on who's mentioned in a scene or an act.

\examples{
# Active configuration matrix
data(rksp.0)
cfg <- configuration(rksp.0)
# Passive configuration matrix
cfg <- configuration(rksp.0, mode="Passive")
