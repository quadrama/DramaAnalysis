\usage{
keyness(ft, categories = c(1, rep(2, nrow(ft) - 1)), epsilon = 1e-100,
  siglevel = 0.05, method = c("loglikelihood", "logratio"),
  minimalFrequency = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{ft}{The frequency table}

\item{categories}{A factor or numeric vector that represents an assignment of categories.}

\item{epsilon}{null values are replaced by this value, in order to avoid division by zero}

\item{siglevel}{Return only the keywords above the significance level. Set to 1 to get all words}

\item{method}{Either "logratio" or "loglikelihood" (default)}

\item{minimalFrequency}{Words less frequent than this value are not considered at all}
}
\value{
A list of keywords, sorted by their log-likelihood or log ratio value, calculated according to \href{http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/llwizard.html}{http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/llwizard.html}.
}
\description{
Given a frequency table (with texts as rows and words as columns),
this function calculates log-likelihood and log ratio of one set of rows against the other rows. 
The return value is a list containing scores for each word. If the method 
is \code{loglikelihood}, the returned scores are unsigned G2 values. To estimate the 
\emph{direction} of the keyness, the \code{log ratio} is more informative. A nice introduction 
into log ratio can be found \href{http://cass.lancs.ac.uk/log-ratio-an-informal-introduction/}{here}.
}
\examples{
data("rksp.0")
ft <- frequencytable(rksp.0, byFigure = TRUE, normalize = FALSE)
# Calculate log ratio for all words
genders <- factor(c("m", "m", "m", "m", "f", "m", "m", "m", "f", "m", "m", "f", "m"))
keywords <- keyness(ft, method = "logratio", 
                    categories = genders, 
                    minimalFrequency = 5)
# Remove words that are not significantly different
keywords <- keywords[names(keywords) \%in\% names(keyness(ft, siglevel = 0.01))]
