\usage{
keyness(ft, row = 1, epsilon = 1e-100, siglevel = 0.05,
  method = c("loglikelihood", "logratio"), minimalFrequency = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{ft}{The frequency table}

\item{row}{The row number we want to compare to the others, can be a vector of row numbers}

\item{epsilon}{null values are replaced by this value, in order to avoid division by zero}

\item{siglevel}{Return only the keywords above the significance level. Set to 1 to get all words}

\item{method}{Either "logratio" or "loglikelihood" (default)}

\item{minimalFrequency}{Words less frequent than this value are not considered at all}
}
\value{
A list of keywords, sorted by their log-likelihood value, calculated according to http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/llwizard.html
}
\description{
Given a frequency table (with texts as rows and words as columns),
this function calculates log-likelihood and log ratio of one set of rows against the other rows. 
The return value is a list containing scores for each word
}
\examples{
data("rksp.0")
ft <- frequencytable(rksp.0, byFigure = TRUE, normalize = FALSE)
# Calculate log ratio for all words
keywords <- keyness(ft, method="logratio", row=7, minimalFrequency = 5)
# Remove words that are not significantly different
keywords <- keywords[names(keywords) \%in\% names(keyness(ft, row=1,siglevel=0.01))]
